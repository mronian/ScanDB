  <b>Paoli's = Great service + Fantastic food</b>, 7/30/2006<BR>
  Reviewer: R.K. Landau
 from Santa Barbara, CA
  <BR>
  By far and away the BEST deep dish pizza I have EVER tried (and I've tried pizza's from all around the world).  But I don't just go there for the pizza.  EVERYTHING on their menu is pretty good, and that's because it's made from the finest, freshest ingredients.
Well, I better stop...The more I write, the more hungry I become.  At least I know what I'm having for dinner tonight (Paoli's pizza, of course).<BR><BR>

  <b>In a town of so many italian restraunts...</b>, 7/24/2006<BR>
  Reviewer: hajir Sailors
 from Santa Barbara
  <BR>
  In santa barbara it seems on every street there's another italian restraunt.  Many of them are great, some of them good, some not so good.  This restraunt is cute, quaint, and has a nice selection of pastas, but in a town of so many italian restraunts, there's no real point.  The food is moderate to good, but the pasta is really not much better than the pasta served at the city college cafeteria which isn't bad pasta at all, on the contrary it's good but the price is much higher at paolis.  There's nothing special about serving size, no real signature dishes, i even had the paoli pasta to see if that was anything special and it wasn't.  Now the Chicken Marsala is good, and the pizzas are excellent, but for the price you can easily go somewhere else, and i'm afraid i would much rather be going to Ca'Dario.  Now the one thing i will give them other than the pizzas being excellent is the bread that is served with your meal is so good that if you had time, and you had been to some of the other good restraunts in the area, and you were in the neighborhood, then you might just want to stop by.<BR><BR>

  Reviewer: Melanie Kuecker

  We loved the atmosphere and food at this quaint little Italian restaurant so much that we ended up there 3 times over our week and a half honeymoon!  The pasta is delicious and made to order!  Perfect for picky eaters!  Eat here!<BR><BR>

  <b>Yummy</b><BR>
  Reviewer: Erika Swanstrom
 from Thousand Oaks, CA
  <BR>
  Who would have known that you could bake an entire artichoke?  It was so good.  They give big glasses of wine and their bread is incredibly delicious.  They are so centrally located.  You can shop on state street, eat some good Italian food and then walk across the street to the beach.  My entire family went their for father's day after my sister's graduation last year and there wasn't one complaint.  It is now mine and my boyfriend's favorite place to eat when we drive to Santa Barbara.<BR><BR>

  <b>Best pizza anywhere!</b><BR>
  Reviewer: Vanessa
 from Los Angeles
  <BR>
  My first time in Santa Barbara I chose this restaurant to try something new, and now, I make it a permanent staple on my vacations to Santa Barbara. I have been to all over Italy, and many times to New York, and there is no place that has pizza like Paoli's! The crust is so flavorful and the ingrediants are plentiful and fresh! I am a huge fan of the pizza and wish I had a Paoli's in my hometown!<BR><BR>

 from santa barbara

  Last time i ate here there was white sand at the bottom of my salad which the waitress tried to dismiss as ground pepper which i did not ask for when she offered it to me. the bread has improved though.I hope this honest review does not get deleted again.<BR><BR>

  <b>cannoli</b><BR>
  <BR>
  Excellent excellent cannoli...we will definitely be back for dessert.  The dinner was a special of pasta and shellfish with tomatoes in kind of a broth.  It was excellent as well.  College night can be a bit noisy but otherwise a pleasant atmosphere where two people can have an enjoyable dinner and quiet conversation.<BR><BR>

  Reviewer: Ryan
 from Santa Barbara, Ca.
  <BR>
  Took my girlfriend to Paolis on a monday night (mondays are half off everything ont he menu!!!!) and had quite a bit of food, including a large pizza with all kinds of stuff on it.  i almost died when i saw how good the pizza looked, and the taste was even better.
the service was semi-slow, but the wait was worth it!

  <b>The best kept secret in Santa Barbara</b><BR>
  <BR>
  Went there tonight with my girlfriend to celebrate her birthday.  We ordered the pasta with clams as well as a pizza, and fried calamari as an appetizer.  Everything was absolutely delicious, the best meal I have had in Santa Barbara the two years I have been here.  Highly recommended.<BR><BR>

  <b>True patio, excellant prices, superb service</b><BR>
  Reviewer: barbara
 from Wisconsin
  <BR>
  A quaint neighborhood setting, yet right on State St.. We sat on the patio, which is semi enclosed from the street, so you don&acute;t get car fumes from 2 feet away, yet you get the view of walkers and cars lovin&acute; State St.  We could afford the meal and tip appropriately for the great service.  I hate to tell people about this place because too many others will discover it and take away the ambiance and make it crowded and noisey, but I have to pass on the good word<BR><BR>

  <b>Horrible Food/Atrocious Service</b><BR>
  Reviewer: Nicole
 from Bay Area, CA
  <BR>
   Our first (and LAST!!!) visit lasted less than five minutes. When I asked for a place setting the waiter huffed and rolled his eyes. The garlic rolls they brought out looked like lumps of charcoal. They should have been ashamed to put it on our table. My friend ordered a sangria and it had about two drops of sangria and 50 cubes of ice. When she pointed this out to the waiter he blamed her for not specifying light ice (she didn&acute;t ask for ice in the first place and according to their manager they don&acute;t usually put ice in their sangria&acute;s). The waiter brought her back a half empty glass which was still mostly full of ice. My daquiri had a chunk of ice in it the size of a pager which I pointed out to the manager and she chose to ignore. I have never been to a restaurant with such rude, snotty, unprofessional employees. ENTER AT YOUR OWN RISK!!<BR><BR>

  <b>excellent food, friendly service, great pizza</b><BR>
  Reviewer: marc and dana russo
 from montecito, california
  <BR>
  a wonderful &acute;neighborhood&acute; feeling establishment. we were drawn in one fortunate evening by the fireplace and the color of the restaurant and found a treasure that we&acute;ve returned to many times with many friends to share the secret. 
the helpings are hearty and delicious with excellent pricings for the fare. the pizza is also HANDS DOWN the best in s.b.! the service is friendly and even though it&acute;s tightly staffed and very busy sometimes, as it can be on weekends, you&acute;ll still get a satisfying dining experience. 
don&acute;t rush the meal~ savor the smells and tastes, some good wine and conversation, and you&acute;ll leave very happy, like we&acute;ve done, as well as ALL of the friends we&acute;ve shared santa barbara&acute;s best kept secret with. <BR><BR>

  I had the most amazing salmon here.  Everything was priced well and the service was great,  I will return whenever I visit Santa Barbara.  Also when I was there Paolis was hosting the nicest wedding reception outside on their patio and everyine seemed to be having a great time. <BR><BR>
