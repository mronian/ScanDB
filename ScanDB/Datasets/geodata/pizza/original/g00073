  This was my first visit to Rusty's Pizza.
#1  Fast service
#2  Crust was cooked perfect and tasted great!
#3  Plenty of sauce & cheese.
I plan on returning to Rusty's on my next visit to SB.  Highly recommended!<BR><BR>

  <b>Rusty's...the "Denny's" of pizza parlors</b>, 2/10/2006<BR>
  Reviewer: Ryland
 from Santa Barbara, CA
  <BR>
  Mediocre at best, and not very consistent. Yes, I've been to 4 different Rusty's in the SB area multiple times in the last 4 years. Shame on me. One time they can be so so, another really bad. The service at the upper State St. location is the best IMHO. If they would would come up with a better crust, not be so skimpy with the toppings and get their beer colder than room temperature they would rise up to maybe a Chucky Cheese level. If you want good pizza in SB go to Giovanni's or Deano's.<BR><BR>

  <b>Terrible Over-priced Pizza</b>, 8/22/2005<BR>
  Reviewer: SB Pizza Lover
 from Santa Barbara, CA
  <BR>
  I moved to Santa Barbara in January and this is first place I ate that evening. What a huge disappointment! The pizza borders on flavorless cardboard and it took forever to get the pizza. I think they need a new pizza recipe that includes a more moist crust, a less acid sauce and perhaps more liberal use of cheese and toppings. The staff is pleasant, but lethargic and the decor interesting but not comfortable. While I feel that Rusty's did not do a bad job, they just serve a mediocre product.<BR><BR>

  Reviewer:  
 from Goleta, CA

  The pizza here is overpriced and terrible.  We ordered the barbeque chicken pizza, and we tasted mustard in the pizza sauce.  The "barbeque" came from the sauce they squirted in a circle on top of the pizza.<BR><BR>

  <b>TERRIBLE pizza</b>, 8/15/2005<BR>
  Reviewer: Jane
 from Santa Barbara
  <BR>
  As New Yorkers fresh off the plane, we were hungry, craved some pizza and didn't know where to order from so we called Rusty's.  We ordered one large pie with two toppings - a whoppin' $20!  The pizza was TERRIBLE.  Absolutley COLD when we opened the box.  There is NOTHING special about this pizza and we were both feeling very sick afterwards.  As someone who knows good pizza from the East coast, take it from me...it's not worth your trip or your money!<BR><BR>

  <b>Poorest service ever</b>, 8/10/2005<BR>
  Reviewer: They know who I am
 from Santa Barbara
  <BR>
  Probably the highest priced pizza in the US and the worst service ever. Delivered the wrong item,and after paying 25 dollars for a pizza and a salad, was only told "we can credit you two dollars". This company should be ashamed of themselves. I will no longer go here for myself or for my company. Pizza places are a dime a dozen and Rusty's should remember that.<BR><BR>

  A resonable good pizza, nothing special. One thing is that it is better if you take it out and bring it around the pool. Building is nice but inside needs some improvements. Not impressed by salad bar. Service efficient<BR><BR>

  The pizza at Rusty&acute;s is way too expensive, I just ordered a MEDIUM pizza with everything along with two cans of coke: $20.  That is just ridiculous.  I can go over to Domino&acute;s which is just as good (if you ask me) and get three mediums delivered for just 18.00.  

If you&acute;re looking for good pizza that is worth the money, call up Giovannie&acute;s, or better yet, stop by and get their slice and a salad deal.  <BR><BR>

  <b>i wish i could give em a zero!!</b><BR>
  <BR>
  I grew up in SB eating at Rusty&acute;s and used to like their pizza. Ever since I ate at the Rusty&acute;s on the beach my taste for them went downhill. The service and attitude of the employes at this restaurant was so bad I wanted to throw my pie back at the counter and never return.  Santa Barbara would be better off if this location of Rusty&acute;s pizza fell into Mission creek and was swept out to sea and never heard of again. I will never eat at Rusty&acute;s again and think all of those employees should be terminated!!! <BR><BR>

  <b>Rusty&acute;s BAH !!</b><BR>
  Reviewer: Steve O
 from santa barbara , CA USA
  <BR>
  I was born & raised in SB and have enjoyed Rusty&acute;s time and time again, but they&acute;re over over rated. Rusty&acute;s is on the  expensive side  and hella greasy. I remember back in the day when they didn&acute;t charge for delivery. If you are looking for a GR8 alterative where the cost is halved and the toppings doubled you seek DEANO&acute;S on the Mesa. Now that is the BEST Pizza in town, also Giovanni&acute;s or Taffy&acute;s pizza joints are close contenders

  <b>Best Pie - Fastest Delivery Any Where!!</b><BR>
  Reviewer: Stan
 from Santa Barbara 
  <BR>
  Pizza is very subjective but I can say without hesitation that Rusty&acute;s is an exceptional regional pizza shop.  The pie is absolutely unique and to my taste one of the best in the country.  I have ordered dozens of times and have always had a hot and extra fast delivery.  I can without reservation say that if you placed an order with Rusty&acute;s and any of the major chains at the same time, you will receive your Rusty&acute;s pizza, eat your pizza and cleanup before the competition even arrives at your door.  One very very happy customer for over 10 years!!<BR><BR>

  I grew up here in Santa Barbara and used to (USED TO) love Rusty&acute;s as a kid...when they had good service (drivers didn&acute;t ask you &quot;how much change you want back&quot; - i.e. &acute;how much of a tip are you gonna give me&acute;), delivered the pizza in a reasonable amount of time (not  1.5 hours after placing the order), GOT YOUR ORDER RIGHT (literally every other time at of the last 9 times I&acute;ve ordered it has arrived at my door wrong), and didn&acute;t &acute;over-charge&acute; for delivery service (old cost = $0.00, new &acute;delivery charge&acute; = $2.00+) without even informing you.<BR><BR>

  <b>Great thin California pizza</b><BR>
  Reviewer: Shaun

  Rusty&acute;s is hands-down the best pizza in SB, classic and always good.  If you wnt NY style pizza, try Uncle Roccos on State St, its good too!<BR><BR>

  <b>Rusty&acute;s is Crusty</b><BR>
  Reviewer: Eric
  <BR>
  I have had several people who swear by Rusty&acute;s great tasting food and I have to say I agree with all the other negative reviews.  The food reminded me of Chuckie Chees pizza and that stuff rates a 10+ on the barf meter.  Do your self a favor and buy a Digiorno before ever considering eating at a Rusty&acute;s. Blech!

  I have been eating at Rusty&acute;s for years. None of the other pizza parlors compare to Rusty&acute;s. My daughter also loves their pizza. Those guys think Rusty&acute;s is the worst pizza?! They obviously haven&acute;t tried LITTLE CEASERS!!!<BR><BR>

  <b>NY Pizza lovers vers. Rusty&acute;s Pizza</b><BR>
  Reviewer: Dan
 from Santa Barbara, CA
  <BR>
  For you NY Pizza lovers, You can&acute;t expect to have NY Pizza in California. Comparing the two is like apples and oranges. NY is famous for their Pizza and Rusty&acute;s is famous for there Pizza in California.  You can&acute;t find a better pizza that gets delivered that&acute;s for sure.  I have eaten here for four years and got to say that it&acute;s better than Dominos Pizza. I was looking to see if we could order on-line when I found this site.<BR><BR>

   I can&acute;t believe that so many people think that Rusty&acute;s pizza is gross, it is some of the best pizza out there. You pick up one piece, and you just can&acute;t stop. It&acute;s been around for a long time, and it has become my family&acute;s prefered pizza.<BR><BR>

  Rusty&acute;s is the best pizza parlor in California. Plus, you get to eat outside watching the beach if want to. it is expensive but worth it. <BR><BR>

  Reviewer: Kelley

  I was visiting San Barbara on vacation with my friend and we had Rustys for dinner one night, it was by far the best pizza i have ever had.  I have lived in Los Angeles my whole life and have pizza from all over California, Rustys is by far my favorite!  Fresh ingredients and thick crust...very yummy!!!<BR><BR>

  I had to take an 8 yr. old to Rusty&acute;s while I was babysitting, and it was the worst  pizza that I&acute;ve had in a long while. The folks who have traveled and claim that Rusty&acute;s is in a league with pizza from other places must have been eating at Domino&acute;s and the like. I would even take Domino&acute;s over this stuff. There is good pizza in town--Uncle Rocco&acute;s New York Pizza comes to mind--but Rusty&acute;s is where you take a passle of kids who don&acute;t know the difference between good pie and bad.<BR><BR>

  <b>Rusty&acute;s is by far the best pizza in SB</b><BR>
  <BR>
  I have travelled the US and have tried many different pizza from NY Thin Pizza to Chicago&acute;s Deep Dish Pizza-even the various chains such as Papa Murphys,Pizza Hut,Dominoes,Pizza Kitchen,Roundtable, etc. and Rusty&acute;s Pizza is by far the best pizza unless you live in Chicago or NY.  But don&acute;t let anyone tell you what is good and what is not.  Try it for yourself. <BR><BR>

  Rusty&acute;s Pizza is not terrible like the guy below says. It is just a style of pizza he doesn&acute;t like. They have many stores throughout SB and are hugely popular locally. I love the stuff.<BR><BR>

  <b>Hot, Delicious, the Best Pizza in Town!</b><BR>
  <BR>
  I love Rusty&acute;s when I&acute;m in the mood for Pizza.  They have a great system where when you call in, they keep a record of you, so that in future, if you are like me, and tend to order the same thing over and over, you don&acute;t have to repeat every single topping you want.  They make their pizza&acute;s from scratch the moment you call in and sometimes call you back when it is ready to be picked up.  The crust is moist and hearty, the vegetables extraordinarily fresh.  No one can compete with Rusty&acute;s because they are the best.  The only criticism I have is that they are a little bit expensive.  However, if you want high quality pizza with all the freshest ingredients as opposed to something not as obviously fresh, it is definitely worth spending a few extra bucks on.  <BR><BR>

  <b>From Chicago to California...no one else comes close!</b><BR>
  Reviewer: Steve Vail
 from Provo, Utah
  <BR>
  Domino&acute;s and Pizza hut...?  Are you kidding me?  You need to go back to eating happy meals because you don&acute;t deserve to have a standard... nor an opinion, at least not a valid one.  I grew up eating Rusty&acute;s pizza, and have since traveled far and wide in search of a similar (not better, just in the same ballpark) pie.  And sadly, I have failed.  I&acute;m about 700 miles away from the closest Rusty&acute;s or I&acute;d be writing this from their location on a laptop, spilling Ranch and toppings all over my keyboard.  I need to stop, or I&acute;m going to drive myself crazy just thinking about how bad I miss that place.  Shame on you for having the ba... nerve to write a bad review of the one thing I miss more than the ocean...Rusty&acute;s Pizza!  Stay strong Rusty&acute;s...and charge whatever you want cause you&acute;re worth it!<BR><BR>

  <b>Not terrible, not great</b><BR>
  Reviewer: Frank Barth
 from Santa Barbara
  <BR>
  I seriously question what sort of standards some of the people who have written reviews here have. As &quot;good as it gets&quot; in California?  Please.  Santa Barbara is a poor pizza town and there&acute;s better pizza available within city limits!  It simply pales next to the dozens of superior pies to be found just in San Francisco and LA, for instance.  It&acute;s not bad stuff, just unexceptional, and a little bland. And I docked a star for the screamingly high prices.  Simply not worth the price, not when Domino&acute;s and Pizza Hut supply similarly generic but acceptable product at a much lower cost.<BR><BR>
